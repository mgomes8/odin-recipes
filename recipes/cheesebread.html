        <p>Brazilian Cheese Puffs, fully loaded Pão de Queijo with Parmesan cheese. These cheese puffs are addictive and taste just like Brazilian restaurant's.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>10 oz. tapioca flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups grated Permesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 °F (176°C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place the milk, oil, and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat as soon as you see big bubbles coming through the milk.</li>
            <li>Add the tapioca flour and stir with a wooden spoon until well combined. Transfer the dough to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat the dough for a few minutes at medium speed until it smooths out and has cooled down.</li>
            <li>With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs into the dough one at a time, waiting until the first egg is fully incorporated before adding the second. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the cheese until it forms a very sticky dough.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with a small ice cream scoop, spacing them 2-inches apart (12 per baking sheet). Dip your scoop in water between scoops to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes then rotate the baking sheets from front to back. Bake for another 10 or 15 minutes until until the puffs have puffed and the bottoms turn golden-brown on the bottoms.</li>
        </ol>
