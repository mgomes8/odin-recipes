        <p>If you would like to prep this salad a few hours in advance, just combine everything except the arugula in a large mixing bowl, place the arugula lightly on top, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Then give the salad a good toss right before serving and enjoy!</p>
        <p>There are about a million ways that you can customize this salad. So feel free to get creative and use what ingredients you love most (or need to use up in your kitchen!) and make this one your own.</p>
